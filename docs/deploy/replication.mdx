In production settings, we recommend deploying ParadeDB as a replica of your primary Postgres. This allows ParadeDB to
integrate with managed Postgres providers like RDS. It also isolates search and analytical workloads from your primary Postgres,
which can prevent downtime caused by long-running queries.

In this guide, we'll walk through setting up logical replication for ParadeDB. This setup allows you to replicate data from a primary server to one or more standby servers.
Replication is useful for high availability or for ParadeDB to run as a search replica over your primary Postgres.

### Environment Setup

We'll use the following environment setup for our demonstration:

**Primary Server**

- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04
- **IP**: 192.168.0.30
- **Database Name**: `marketplace`
- **Replication User**: `replicator`
- **Replication Password**: `passw0rd`

**Standby Servers**

- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04
- **IP**: `192.168.0.31`, `192.168.0.32`

## Primary Server Setup

Follow these steps in order to set up the primary server.

### Edit `postgresql.conf`

The `postgresql.conf` file is the main configuration file for PostgreSQL. It contains all the server settings that control the behavior and performance of your PostgreSQL instance.
Ensure that your `postgresql.conf` has the following settings applied:

```ini
listen_addresses = 'localhost,192.168.0.30'
max_wal_senders = 10
```

- `listen_addresses` specifies the IP addresses on which PostgreSQL listens for connections. By default, PostgreSQL only listens on `localhost`. To allow other servers (like your standby servers) to connect for replication, you need to include their IP addresses.
- `max_wal_senders` determines the maximum number of concurrent connections that can send WAL (Write-Ahead Log) data.

If you are running `pg_search` on the primary server, make sure to add it to `shared_preload_libraries`. If you are installing it only on the standby server as a search replica,
you should skip this step.

```ini
# Include this only if pg_search is installed on the primary
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_search'
```

### Edit `pg_hba.conf`

The `pg_hba.conf` file (PostgreSQL Host-Based Authentication file) controls client authentication, defining who can connect to the PostgreSQL server, how they can connect, and from where. It ensures that only authorized users and systems can access the database.

We need to allow the replication user to connect from the standby servers' IP addresses. Add the following lines to allow replication from the local network and localhost. This configuration ensures that the replication user can connect from the specified IP range.

```ini
local   replication     all                                     peer
host    replication     all             127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256
host    replication     all             ::1/128                 scram-sha-256
host    replication     all             192.168.0.0/24          scram-sha-256
```

### Create the Replication User

In PostgreSQL, a user is required to handle replication connections securely. This user needs specific permissions to read the WAL and perform replication tasks.

Creating a dedicated replication user ensures that the replication process is secure and isolated from other database operations. This user will have the necessary permissions to perform replication but will not have broader administrative privileges.

```bash
sudo -u postgres createuser --pwprompt --replication replicator
```

`--pwprompt` prompts you to enter a password for the new user. In this tutorial, we will be setting the password to `passw0rd`.

`--replication` grants the replication privilege to the new user, allowing it to handle replication tasks.

### Create Mock Table on Primary

Create a database:

```bash
sudo -u postgres -H createdb marketplace
```

Insert some data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mock_items (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  description TEXT,
  rating INTEGER CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
  category VARCHAR(255),
  in_stock BOOLEAN,
  metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  last_updated_date DATE,
  latest_available_time TIME
);


INSERT INTO mock_items (description, category, in_stock, latest_available_time, last_updated_date, metadata, created_at, rating)
VALUES ('Red sports shoes', 'Footwear', true, '12:00:00', '2024-07-10', '{}', '2024-07-10 12:00:00', 1);
```

If you have installed `pg_search` on the primary, you can build a BM25 index over the table.

```sql
-- Skip this if pg_search is not installed on the primary
CALL paradedb.create_bm25(
  table_name => 'mock_items',
  index_name => 'mock_items',
  schema_name => 'public',
  key_field => 'id',
  text_fields => paradedb.field('description')
);
```

### Run pg_basebackup

You should run `pg_basebackup` on your standby server to create a physical byte-for-byte replica of your primary cluster. The `--pgdata` directory specifies the where the standby cluster will be created. The directory must exist, and must be empty.

```bash
mkdir -p /var/lib/postgresql/16/main

pg_basebackup --create-slot --slot standby1 --host 192.168.0.30 --pgdata /var/lib/postgresql/16/main --progress --username replicator --write-recovery-conf
pg_basebackup --create-slot --slot standby2 --host 192.168.0.30 --pgdata /var/lib/postgresql/16/main --progress --username replicator --write-recovery-conf
```

### Start PostgreSQL on Standby Server

Start PostgreSQL on standby servers:

```bash
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

### Verification

Now you can verify the replication. The data inserted on the primary server should appear on the standby servers, confirming that streaming replication with ParadeDB is working correctly.

```sql
SELECT * FROM mock_items.search('description:shoes')
```

## Logical Replication Setup

Logical replication allows you to replicate changes to specific tables between PostgreSQL instances. After creating a physical replica with `pg_basebackup`, you can set up a subscription to propagate changes on the primary server to the standby.

### Create Publication on Primary

```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION mock_items_pub FOR TABLE mock_items;
```

### Create Subscription on Standy

```sql
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION sub_marketplace
CONNECTION 'host=172.16.0.1 port=5432 dbname=marketplace user=replicator password=passw0rd'
PUBLICATION pub_marketplace;
```

### Insert Data on Publisher

```sql
INSERT INTO mock_items (description, category, in_stock, latest_available_time, last_updated_date, metadata, created_at, rating)
VALUES ('Blue running shoes', 'Footwear', true, '14:00:00', '2024-07-10', '{}', '2024-07-10 14:00:00', 2)
```

### Verification

Verify the replication on the Subscriber server:

```sql
SELECT description FROM mock_items.search('description:"running shoes"');
```

The data inserted on the Publisher server should appear on the Subscriber server.

## Schema Changes in Logical Replication

ParadeDB leverages PostgreSQLâ€™s built-in logical replication to provide flexible and efficient data synchronization, and is subject to the same limitations. A well-known caveat of logical replication is that schema changes (DDL commands) are not replicated. This means that any changes to the schema on the source database, such as adding new columns or tables, will not be automatically applied to the subscriber.

```sql
-- On Publisher
ALTER TABLE mock_items ADD COLUMN num_stock;
INSERT INTO mock_items (description, category, in_stock, latest_available_time, last_updated_date, metadata, created_at, rating, num_stock)
VALUES ('Green running shoes', 'Footwear', true, '14:00:00', '2024-07-09', '{}', '2024-07-09 14:00:00', 2, 900);

-- On Subscriber
ERROR: logical replication target relation "public.mock_items" is missing some replicated columns
```

To work around this, pause the subscription on the subscriber, manually apply the schema changes, then resume the subscription:

```sql
-- On Subscriber
ALTER SUBSCRIPTION mock_items_sub DISABLE;
ALTER TABLE entries ADD COLUMN num_stock int;
ALTER SUBSCRIPTION mock_items_sub ENABLE;
```

If new tables are added and your publication is not `FOR ALL TABLES`, add them to the publication manually:

```sql
-- On Publisher
ALTER PUBLICATION mock_items_pub ADD TABLE newly_added_table;

-- On Subscriber
ALTER SUBSCRIPTION mock_items_sub REFRESH PUBLICATION;
```
