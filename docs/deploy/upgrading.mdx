title: Update ParadeDB
---

## Overview

ParadeDB ships all of its functionality via Postgres extensions. All updates to ParadeDB can be
received by updating one or more of the following extensions:

1. `pg_analytics` for accelerated analytical queries
2. `pg_search` for full text search
3. `pgvector` for dense and sparse vector search

## Getting the Current Version

To inspect the current version of an extension, run the following command.

```sql
-- Get the version of pg_search
SELECT extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_search';
-- Get the version of pg_analytics
SELECT extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_analytics';
```

## Getting the Latest Version

Because `pg_search`, `pg_analytics`, and `pgvector` are independent extensions, they each have their own versions.
For the latest available version, please refer to the respective Github repos:

1. [`pg_search`](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases) is on version `0.9.3`
2. [`pg_analytics`](https://github.com/paradedb/pg_analytics/blob/main/pg_analytics.control) is on version `0.1.2`
3. [`pgvector`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/tags) is on version `0.7.4`

## Updating ParadeDB Docker Image

First, run the following command to pull a specific version of the Docker image. You can set the version number
to `latest` to pull the latest Docker image.

```bash
docker pull paradedb/paradedb:<version_number>
```

The latest version of the Docker image should be `0.9.3`. Then, run the following commands to upgrade all extensions to their latest version.

```sql
ALTER EXTENSION pg_search UPDATE TO '0.9.3';
ALTER EXTENSION pg_analytics UPDATE TO '0.1.2';
ALTER EXTENSION pgvector UPDATE TO '0.7.4';
```

## Updating Extensions

If you are running the extensions in a self-managed Postgres, first download and install the extension you wish to upgrade in the same way that it was initially
installed. Then, you can run the same `ALTER EXTENSION` commands as above.

```sql
ALTER EXTENSION <extension_name> UPDATE TO '<extension_version>';
```
