title: Install Third Party Extensions
---

Postgres has a rich ecosystem of extensions. To keep the size of the ParadeDB Dockerfile small, only the ParadeDB extensions — `pg_search` and `pg_analytics` — and a limited set of third party extensions are included.
However, additional extensions can be installed inside ParadeDB.

## Default Extensions

ParadeDB ships with:

- `pg_search` for full text search
- `pg_analytics` for fast queries over data lakes
- `pgvector` for vector search
- `pg_ivm` for incremental materialized views
- `pg_cron` for cron jobs

<Note>
  `pg_cron` is configured on the default `postgres` database and cannot be
  changed.
</Note>

## Installing Third Party Extensions

The process for installing an extension varies by extension. Generally speaking, it requires:

- Compile from source or download the prebuilt binaries inside ParadeDB
- Install the extension binary and any dependencies inside ParadeDB
- Add the extension to `shared_preload_libraries` in `postgresql.conf`, if required by the extension
- Run `CREATE EXTENSION <extension name>`

We recommend installing prebuilt binaries whenever available to keep the image size small. Most popular
As an example, let's install [PostGIS](https://github.com/postgis/postgis), an extension for geospatial data.

### Install Prebuilt Binaries

First, enter a shell with root permissions in the ParadeDB image.

```bash
docker exec -it --user root paradedb bash
```

<Note>
  This command assumes that your ParadeDB container name is `paradedb`.
</Note>

Next, install the [prebuilt binaries](https://postgis.net/documentation/getting_started/install_ubuntu/).
Most Postgres extensions can be installed with `apt-get install`.

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends postgis postgresql-16-postgis-3
```

### Add to `shared_preload_libraries`

Some extensions like PostGIS must be added to `shared_preload_libraries` in `postgresql.conf`. Inside `postgresql.conf`,
set:

```ini
shared_preload_libraries = 'postgis'
```

Postgres must be restarted afterward.

```bash
pg_ctl restart -D /var/lib/postgresql/data
```

### Creating the Extension

Connect to ParadeDB and create the extension.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
```

`postgis` is now ready to use!

## Popular Third Party Extensions

A few other extensions that ParadeDB does not ship with include

- [pg_partman](https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman) for automatic partition management
- [pgaudit](https://github.com/pgaudit/pgaudit) for audit logging
- [pg_repack](https://github.com/reorg/pg_repack) for removing bloat from tables
