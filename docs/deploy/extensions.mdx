title: Install Third Party Extensions
---

Postgres has a rich ecosystem of extensions which enable a variety of specialized workloads. ParadeDB itself is built via two Postgres extensions,
`pg_search` and `pg_analytics`, which we develop. In order to keep the size of the ParadeDB image small, it only ships with the ParadeDB extensions
and a limited set of necessary third party extensions.

However, it is possible to install any other third party extension in the ParadeDB image.

## Default Extensions

ParadeDB ships with the following Postgres extensions installed by default:

- pg_search
- pg_analytics
- pgvector
- pg_ivm
- pg_cron

Note that the pg_cron installation is configured on the default `postgres` database and cannot be changed.

You do not need to install any of these extensions or run `CREATE EXTENSION` manually. They will be available by default
in any new database created in ParadeDB.

## Installing Third Party Extensions

To install a third party extension, you will need to:

- Locate its source code or prebuilt binaries
- Retrieve a Bash shell inside the ParadeDB Docker image or Kubernetes cluster via `docker exec -it paradedb bash`
- Compile or retrieve the binary for Debian 12 and Postgres 16, which are the OS and Postgres versions ParadeDB ships with
- Download and install the binary inside the ParadeDB Docker image or ParadeDB Kubernetes cluster
- Downland and install dependencies inside the ParadeDB Docker image or ParadeDB Kubernetes cluster, if any
- Connect to ParadeDB via `psql` and run `CREATE EXTENSION <extension_name>`

Note that the compilation instructions and the availability of prebuilt binaries will differ from extension to extension. Due to
the nature of third party extensions, ParadeDB is unable to guarantee compatibility with our image. We expect most extensions to be
be compatible out-of-the-box. You can always [contact us in Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/paradedbcommunity/shared_invite/zt-2lkzdsetw-OiIgbyFeiibd1DG~6wFgTQ) with
questions and we will be happy to help.

### Popular Third Party Extensions

Here is a shortlist of popular third party extensions which ParadeDB does not ship with by default:

- [PostGIS - Spatial Database Extension for PostgreSQL](https://github.com/postgis/postgis) (Note: We plan to eventually ship with PostGIS by default)
- [pg_partman - PostgreSQL Partition Manager](https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman)
- [pgaudit - Open Source PostgreSQL Audit Logging](https://github.com/pgaudit/pgaudit)

There are many others. You can find a comprehensive list of extensions in [Pigsty](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgext/list/) or [PGXN](https://pgxn.org/).
