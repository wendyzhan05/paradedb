title: Install Third Party Extensions
---

Postgres has a rich ecosystem of extensions which enable a variety of specialized workloads. ParadeDB itself is built via two Postgres extensions,
`pg_search` and `pg_analytics`.

To keep the size of the ParadeDB image small, only the ParadeDB extensions and a limited set of necessary third party extensions are included. It is,
however, possible to install arbitrary third party extensions in the ParadeDB image.

## Default Extensions

ParadeDB ships with the following Postgres extensions installed by default:

- pg_search
- pg_analytics
- pgvector
- pg_ivm
- pg_cron

Note that the pg_cron installation is configured on the default `postgres` database and cannot be changed.

Users do not need to install these extensions manually nor run `CREATE EXTENSION` manually to enable them. They will be available by default in any
new database created in ParadeDB.

## Installing Third Party Extensions

At a high-level, installing a third party extension requires:

- Locating its source code or prebuilt binaries.
- Compiling from source or downloading the prebuilt binaries inside the ParadeDB image.
- Installing the extension binary and any dependencies inside the ParadeDB image.
- Adding the extension to `shared_preload_libraries` in `postgresql.conf`, if applicable.
- Creating the extension in a database inside the ParadeDB image to activate it.

We recommend installing prebuilt binaries whenever available to keep the image size small. Most popular
Postgres extensions maintain binaries available via `apt-get install`.

The example below showcases installing PostGIS, a popular extension for geospatial data in Postgres.

<Accordion title="Example - Installing PostGIS">

### Locating the extension prebuilt binaries

The PostGIS repository can be found [here](https://github.com/postgis/postgis). Fortunately, prebuilt binaries are
available via `apt-get`. They can be found [here](https://postgis.net/documentation/getting_started/install_ubuntu/).

### Downloading the prebuilt binaries inside the ParadeDB image

First, we retrieve a shell with root permissions in the ParadeDB image via:

```bash
docker exec -it --user root paradedb bash
```

Note: This command assumes that your ParadeDB container name is `paradedb`.

Then, update the PostgreSQL APT Repository via:

```bash
# Note: This is only necessary if downloading the extension from apt-get
apt-get update

# Install PostGIS
apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends postgis postgresql-16-postgis-3
```

### Installing the extension and dependencies inside the ParadeDB image

Since we downloaded PostGIS via `apt-get` this step is not necessary. When downloading a prebuilt binary
manually via `curl` or `wget`, you will need to install the binary manually via:

```bash
apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ./<package_name>.deb
```

Note: The ParadeDB image does not ship with either wget nor cURL to minimize image size and security risks. If you
need to install the extension outside of apt-get, you will need to first `apt-get install -y curl`. We recommend
that you uninstall it once you are done.

### Adding the extension to `shared_preload_libraries`, if applicable

Certain Postgres extension need to be added to `shared_preload_libraries` in the `postgresql.conf` file
for loading at Postgres startup. PostGIS is one of those extensions. This step is not necessary if the
extension you are installing does not explicitly require being installed in `shared_preload_libraries`.

You can locate the `postgresql.conf` file inside the ParadeDB image at `/var/lib/postgresql/data/postgresql.conf`. To
add PostGIS to it, simply use sed:

```bash
sed -i "/^shared_preload_libraries/s/'\([^']*\)'/'\1,postgis'/" /var/lib/postgresql/data/postgresql.conf
```

Then, restart Postgres for the change to take effect via:

```bash
pg_ctl restart -D /var/lib/postgresql/data
```

You can now close the Bash shell inside the ParadeDB image.

### Creating the extension inside the ParadeDB image

Finally, connect to ParadeDB over `psql` with your ParadeDB Postgres credentials:

```bash
psql -h localhost -U <user> -d <dbname> -p 5432 -W
```

You can enable PostGIS inside your ParadeDB Postgres database via:

```bash
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
```

That's it!

## Popular Third Party Extensions

Here is a shortlist of popular third party extensions which ParadeDB does not ship with by default:

- [PostGIS](https://github.com/postgis/postgis) - Spatial Database Extension for PostgreSQL (Note: We plan to eventually ship with PostGIS by default)
- [pg_partman](https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman) - PostgreSQL Partition Manager
- [pgaudit](https://github.com/pgaudit/pgaudit) - Open Source PostgreSQL Audit Logging
- [pgrepack](https://github.com/reorg/pg_repack) - Reorganize Tables in PostgreSQL Databases with Minimal Locks

There are many others. You can find a comprehensive list of extensions in [Pigsty](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgext/list/) or [PGXN](https://pgxn.org/).
